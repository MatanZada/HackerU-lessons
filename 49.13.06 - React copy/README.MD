what is yarn (npm vs yarn)

if we don't want to show to component - return null inside.

use object for styling

use the state obj (reserved word)

use array of jsx elements =
[<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>,<span>1</span>]

lets use some css.

smart component (with state) and stupid component (wihtout)
we will have something that will determine the state.

lets install some css laybary (tailwind)

const [count, setCount] = setState(0)

webpack - bundling service (packing all of our files to one etc..)

lets show the users? create an array of users, and show it in a table. (lets do it smart.)
