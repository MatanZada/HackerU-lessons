 - How node resolve modules (order - node -> node_module).
 - How to create our own module. (module.export)
 * Prectice -> Create you own file called dollarConverter.js
 inside write a function called `dollarify()` that gets numbner in NIS and convert it to dollar (multiply by 3.1 and add $ sign at the begeaning using another funciton).
 return the value from the funciton.
 export the `dollarify()` funciton in the file.
 in the index.js require the file you wrote './fileName' 
 call the function `dollarify()` is its working?
 call the append string is it working -> Private funciton.
 - import only one some functions from module even if you export it.
 - shard hosting vs managed. (hostgator, digitalocen, aws, google etc..) cost
 - linux vs windows vs mac os.
 - Deploy my server on arm-64
 - Why is localhost is the IP of the server.
